<h3 align="center">Summary</h3>
 
**NIRO** automates the entire process of reconnaisance for you.

it is used in the phase of Footprinting & reconnaissance.
 
NIRO uses lot of tactiques for reconnaissance for example : subdomain enumeration and search directory and ports scanning which helps you getting the maximum and the most interesting subdomains and directory so that you be ahead of the competition.   
  
It also performs SSH brute force, because it is one of the most reliable ways to gain SSH access to servers is by brute-forcing credentials. that will ultimately lead to the discovery of valid login credentials. 
 
So, what are you waiting for Go!  :boom:
